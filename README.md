# Polarization-Image-Visualizer

## Current Functionality
Right now, the GUI only allows you to view sinusoids and not phase angles. You can change the type of image that you are viewing. Changing the type of image should not change the sinusoid plotter.

## Get started
0. Clone repo & download data
1. Create conda environment from environment.yaml file [Instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
2. Run visualizer_gui.py
3. Load an imaging session to view. Select the File menu option and select 'Open'. Select the root directory of the imaging session. Note: If using MacOS you need to change windows to another program and back in order to make the File menu responsive. [BUG](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/125025)
